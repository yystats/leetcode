'''
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

def findPeakElement(nums):
    l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid

    return r


nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
print(findPeakElement(nums) == 5)
